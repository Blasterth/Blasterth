# Hello, there... 👋
I'm Parsa Aryan (Percy Ashdown if you can't pronounce Persian names), a guy interested in Python.

## My Repos 📦

### 1️⃣ Park BMX:
A fan of Persona 😈 series, (©️ Atlus), I've written an RPG game using Python.  
Repository link: https://github.com/Blasterth/Park-BMX-RPG  
Current Release link: https://github.com/Blasterth/Park-BMX-RPG/releases/tag/v1.0.0

### 2️⃣ (Coming Soon) Hex Calculator:
Another thing that I find interesting is the Hexedecimal system (aka Base16), but many people find it confusing. 😕  
I'm working on a program that converts hex numbers into decimal and vice versa, and does hex calculations. 😄
