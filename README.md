# Hello, there... 👋
I'm Parsa Aryan (Percy Ashdown if you find Persian names weird), a guy interested in Python.

## My Repos 📦

### 1️⃣ Park BMX:

### 3️⃣ (Coming Soon) Hex Calculator:
Another thing that I find interesting is the Hexedecimal system (aka Base16), but many people find it confusing. 😕  
I'm working on a program that converts hex numbers into decimal and vice versa, and does hex calculations. 😄
